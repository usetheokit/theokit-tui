# Discover-Execute — Halt-Loop Deep-Research Driver

Reads an approved discovery plan, then drives a halt-loop investigation across `.claude/knowledge-base/references/` (Project A, Project B, Project C), producing a structured technical blueprint.

**Architecture:** wraps the `ralph-loop` plugin's autonomous-iteration mechanism (Stop hook + state file) with a discovery-specific prompt template. Each iteration answers one or more research questions from the plan, appends to the blueprint, and re-evaluates "are all questions answered + all citations real + all coverage corners covered?"

**Halt condition:** the loop emits `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>` only when ALL of:

1. Every research question from the plan is answered in the blueprint.
2. Every citation (file/symbol) in the blueprint exists in `.claude/knowledge-base/references/`.
3. All four coverage corners (tests / deps / tools / techniques) have at least one populated subsection.
4. Acceptance criteria from the plan are observably met.

## Cycle contract

This skill is **phase 3** of [`cycle-discover`](../../rules/cycle-discover.md). The cycle rule is the source of truth for chain order, hard gates (path existence, halt-loop conditions, fabricated citation refusal), stop conditions (3-retry Fase A, fabricated citation without replacement, empty coverage corner without credible source), anti-patterns (never modify .claude/knowledge-base/references/, never fabricate Fase B answers), and rollback. **Read `cycle-discover.md` before invoking this skill.** This SKILL.md retains phase-specific detail (halt-loop workflow, per-iteration prompt, halt-loop invariants).

## When to Trigger

- After `/discover-edge-cases {slug}` returned `DISCOVERY PLAN OK` (or MUST FIX absorbed).
- User explicitly invokes `/discover-execute {slug}` to launch the autonomous loop.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Argument parsing

Accept:

- `/discover-execute {slug}`

The loop runs until every research question is `done` OR `blocked` with reason AND every citation in the blueprint resolves on disk AND all four coverage corners are populated. There is no iteration cap; per-project time budgets declared inside the discovery plan still apply as honest stop conditions that mark questions as `blocked` (see § Stop conditions).

### Step 2 — Resolve plan + initialize blueprint

1. Resolve plan path: `.claude/knowledge-base/discoveries/plans/{slug}-plan.md`.
2. Read it fully. Extract: in-scope projects, research questions, coverage matrix, halt-loop checkpoints.
3. Create the blueprint file at `.claude/knowledge-base/discoveries/blueprints/{slug}-blueprint.md` using `.claude/skills/discover-execute/templates/blueprint-template.md` as the starter.
4. The blueprint starts with all sections present but EMPTY (each section has a `<!-- TBD: Qx -->` placeholder mapping to the research question).

### Step 3 — Build the halt-loop prompt

Read `.claude/skills/discover-execute/prompts/execute-mode-prompt.md` and substitute:

- `{PLAN_SLUG}` — the slug
- `{PLAN_PATH}` — the resolved plan path
- `{BLUEPRINT_PATH}` — the resolved blueprint path

### Step 4 — Pre-flight guard (concurrent-loop safety)

Before invoking ralph-loop, verify `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` (if present in project root) does NOT have `active: true`. Concurrent ralph-loops on overlapping state is a documented anti-pattern (`rules/loop-engine-convention.md § Anti-patterns`). If a stale state file from a prior loop is observed `active`, HALT and surface to human rather than spawning a concurrent loop.

### Step 5 — Invoke ralph-loop (shell-safe positional + flags)

**Read `.claude/rules/loop-engine-convention.md § How to invoke ralph-loop:ralph-loop safely` BEFORE this step.** The ralph-loop positional argument is shell-evaluated; inlining a multi-section driver prompt (backticks / fenced code blocks / `$(...)`) breaks loop startup with a bash parse error. Use the file-referenced pattern.

1. Write the substituted prompt from Step 3 to `.claude/halt-loop-prompts/discover-execute-{plan-slug}.md` (gitignored).
2. Invoke `ralph-loop:ralph-loop` with:
   - Positional prompt (no shell metachars): `Read .claude/halt-loop-prompts/discover-execute-{plan-slug}.md and follow its instructions for this halt-loop iteration.`
   - `--completion-promise 'BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE'`

The ralph-loop plugin:

- Writes `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` (state file)
- Activates the Stop hook
- Feeds the positional prompt back to Claude on each session-exit attempt (Claude re-reads the driver file each iteration)
- Detects `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>` to terminate

### Step 6 — Per-iteration contract

Each iteration of the halt-loop MUST:

1. **Pick the next un-answered research question** from the plan's Coverage Matrix.
2. **Apply the planned method** (Read / Grep / find / git log) using the planned reference project + path. Never `cd` into `.claude/knowledge-base/references/`; never modify it (boundary-check hook blocks).
3. **Synthesize the answer** in the format declared by the plan's "expected answer shape".
4. **Append/update the blueprint** under the section mapped to that question. Replace the `<!-- TBD: Qx -->` placeholder.
5. **Cite the source** — every paragraph or table cell that references behavior MUST link to a `.claude/knowledge-base/references/{project}/{path}:{line}` reference. No claim without citation.
6. **Mark the question DONE** in a session-local progress file under `.claude/knowledge-base/discoveries/.progress-{slug}.json` (gitignored).
7. **Re-evaluate halt condition.** If all four conditions hold (every question answered + every citation verifiable + four corners populated + acceptance criteria met), emit `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>`.

If a research question cannot be answered (e.g., the cited path doesn't exist after all), the iteration:

- Adds a `<!-- BLOCKED: reason -->` comment in the blueprint at that section.
- Lists the blocked question in the progress file.
- Continues to the next question.
- Does NOT emit `BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE` — instead reports honestly that N questions remained blocked.

### Step 7 — Post-promise sanity check

After the loop emits `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>`, run ONCE before the report:

```bash
# Re-verify ALL citations in the blueprint exist on disk
grep -oE '.claude/knowledge-base/references/[^ )`":]+' {BLUEPRINT_PATH} | sort -u | while read -r path; do
  [ -e "$path" ] || echo "FABRICATED: $path"
done
```

If ANY `FABRICATED:` line appears, the promise was emitted with a fabricated citation slipping through. Surface as **PROMISE INTEGRITY VIOLATION** — re-mark the offending claim with `<!-- BLOCKED: ... -->` and re-invoke the loop. NEVER accept the promise at face value.

If the loop emitted `<promise>BLUEPRINT_BLOCKED</promise>`, the sanity check still runs to ensure the BLOCKED report's surfaced blocker count matches the progress file. Drift between the report and `.progress-{slug}.json` blocks handoff.

### Step 8 — Report

After the loop terminates (promise detected OR stop condition fires):

- Path to the produced blueprint
- Number of iterations used
- Questions answered / questions blocked (with blocker reasons)
- Citations verified count (cross-ref against `.progress-{slug}.json`)
- Recommendation: invoke `/discover-confidence {slug}` next

## Halt-loop anti-patterns

- The skill NEVER modifies the discovery plan during execute (use `/discover-improve` for blueprint refinement).
- The skill NEVER touches any file inside `.claude/knowledge-base/references/` (boundary-check hook enforces).
- The skill NEVER runs `npm install`, `pip install`, `poetry install`, or any dependency installer inside `.claude/knowledge-base/references/`.
- The skill NEVER emits `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>` while ANY of the four halt-condition checks fails.
- The skill NEVER emits a promise without the post-promise sanity check (Step 7) confirming on-disk truth.
- The skill NEVER spawns concurrent ralph-loops on overlapping state (Step 4 pre-flight guard).
- The skill NEVER emits `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>` as a graceful exit from a stop condition. When a stop condition fires (see § Stop conditions), the skill emits `<promise>BLUEPRINT_BLOCKED</promise>` (a distinct, honest failure marker) with the blocked-questions report. Forbidden practices specific to per-iteration work are enumerated in `prompts/execute-mode-prompt.md § Inviolable rules`.

## Stop conditions

Emit `<promise>BLUEPRINT_BLOCKED</promise>` (NEVER `BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE`) with explicit BLOCKED report when ANY of:

1. Same question fails twice in a row with no observable progress (same diagnostic, same shape).
2. A fabricated citation cannot be replaced with a real path (recommend re-running `/discover-plan` for that question).
3. A coverage corner has zero credible source after exhaustive Fase A + Fase B passes — recommend `/discover-plan` to revise.
4. A per-project time budget declared inside the discovery plan (ADR D1 or equivalent) is exhausted with questions still `pending` for that project — mark those questions as `blocked` with reason "project time budget exhausted" and continue with the next project; if every remaining project is in the same state, emit `BLUEPRINT_BLOCKED`.
5. Boundary-check hook blocked a write attempt to `knowledge-base/references/` — surfaces an underlying bug, not a content gap; HALT immediately and surface to human.

The promise `<promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>` is emitted EXCLUSIVELY when ALL halt conditions hold (every question `done` or honestly `blocked`, every citation resolves, four corners populated, ≥ 1 ADR present). There is no path that emits `BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE` from a partial state. In all stop-condition cases, `/discover-confidence` MUST NOT honor the blueprint as SHIPPABLE — the BLOCKED report is canonical until the human resolves the blocker. Honest BLOCKED > false COMPLETE (Unbreakable Rule 3).

## Per-iteration prompt skeleton (informational — actual prompt lives in `prompts/execute-mode-prompt.md`)

```
You are mid-discovery, iteration {N}.

Plan: {PLAN_PATH}
Blueprint (in progress): {BLUEPRINT_PATH}
Progress so far: {N answered}/{TOTAL} questions; {M blocked}.

Your next action:
1. Read `.claude/knowledge-base/discoveries/.progress-{slug}.json` to know which questions remain.
2. Pick the next unanswered question with the lowest dependency depth.
3. Apply the planned method.
4. Append the answer to {BLUEPRINT_PATH} under the question's mapped section, with citations.
5. Update `.progress-{slug}.json`.
6. If all halt conditions hold, emit <promise>BLUEPRINT_COMPLETE</promise>. Otherwise, STOP — the loop will resume.
```

## What this skill does NOT do

- Generate the discovery plan — that's `/discover-plan`.
- Review edge cases — that's `/discover-edge-cases`.
- Score the blueprint — that's `/discover-confidence`.
- Refine a low-scoring blueprint — that's `/discover-improve`.
- Modify `.claude/knowledge-base/references/` — forbidden by boundary-check hook.
