# Plan-Improve — Iterative Score Lifter

Reads a plan, scores it with `/plan-confidence`, applies deterministic + semantic fixes, re-scores, and repeats until the plan reaches the target verdict.

**Architecture:** wraps the `ralph-loop` plugin's autonomous-iteration mechanism (Stop hook + state file) with a domain-specific prompt template.

**ADR reference:** see `.claude/skills/plan-confidence/SKILL.md` for the scoring contract.

## Cycle contract

This skill is **phase 4** of [`cycle-plan`](../../rules/cycle-plan.md). The cycle rule is the source of truth for chain order (invoked when `/plan-confidence` verdict < SHIPPABLE_WITH_CAVEATS; followed by `/plan-confidence` re-score), stop conditions (no-improvement detection, hard-cap blockers), anti-patterns (never fabricate ADR alternatives), and rollback. **Read `cycle-plan.md` before invoking this skill.** This SKILL.md retains phase-specific detail (Phase A deterministic fixes, Phase B LLM fixes, fix categories, limitations).

## When to Trigger

User explicitly invokes `/plan-improve {slug}` after seeing a low score from `/plan-confidence` and wanting the system to attempt auto-improvement.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Argument parsing

Accept these forms:
- `/plan-improve {slug}`
- `/plan-improve {slug} --target SHIPPABLE`

Where `{slug}` is the basename of a plan file in `.claude/knowledge-base/plans/` (or auto-detected plans directory).

Defaults:
- `--target`: `SHIPPABLE_WITH_CAVEATS` (the realistic ceiling per ADR D8 + EC-5)

The loop runs until EITHER the target verdict is reached on disk OR a genuine stop condition fires (see § Stop conditions). There is no iteration cap — premature termination would let downstream cycles treat a sub-target plan as improved.

### Step 2 — Resolve plan path

If the argument is a slug, resolve to `.claude/knowledge-base/plans/{slug}-plan.md`. Fall back to `.claude/knowledge-base/plans/completed/{slug}-plan.md` if the active dir doesn't have it.

### Step 3 — Build the improvement prompt

Read `.claude/skills/plan-improve/prompts/improvement-prompt.md` and substitute:
- `{PLAN_SLUG}` — the slug
- `{PLAN_PATH}` — the resolved path
- `{TARGET_VERDICT}` — target band

### Step 4 — Pre-flight guard (concurrent-loop safety)

Before invoking ralph-loop, verify `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` (if present in project root) does NOT have `active: true`. Concurrent ralph-loops on overlapping state is a documented anti-pattern (`rules/loop-engine-convention.md § Anti-patterns`). If a stale state file from a prior loop is observed `active`, HALT and surface to human rather than spawning a concurrent loop.

### Step 5 — Invoke ralph-loop (shell-safe positional + flags)

**Read `.claude/rules/loop-engine-convention.md § How to invoke ralph-loop:ralph-loop safely` BEFORE this step.** The ralph-loop positional argument is shell-evaluated; inlining a multi-section driver prompt (backticks / fenced code blocks / `$(...)`) breaks loop startup with a bash parse error. Use the file-referenced pattern.

1. Write the substituted prompt from Step 3 to `.claude/halt-loop-prompts/plan-improve-{plan-slug}.md` (gitignored).
2. Invoke `ralph-loop:ralph-loop` with:
   - Positional prompt (no shell metachars): `Read .claude/halt-loop-prompts/plan-improve-{plan-slug}.md and follow its instructions for this halt-loop iteration.`
   - `--completion-promise 'PLAN_IMPROVED'`

The ralph-loop plugin:
- Writes `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` (state file)
- Activates the Stop hook
- Feeds the positional prompt back to Claude on each session-exit attempt (Claude re-reads the driver file each iteration)
- Detects `<promise>PLAN_IMPROVED</promise>` to terminate

### Step 6 — Post-promise sanity check

After the loop emits `<promise>PLAN_IMPROVED</promise>`, run ONCE before the report:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/plan-confidence/scripts/run_structural.py {PLAN_PATH} --no-warn
```

Compare the emitted verdict against `--target`. If the post-promise verdict is BELOW `--target`, the loop emitted the marker speculatively — surface as **PROMISE INTEGRITY VIOLATION** and re-invoke. NEVER accept the promise at face value when score-on-disk does not match.

### Step 7 — Report

After the loop terminates AND sanity check passes:
- Initial verdict vs final verdict (post-sanity-check)
- Total changes per category (weak_imperatives, loopholes, tdd_template, adr_alternatives)
- Remaining issues that required human review (if any)
- Diff of all modifications (`git diff` against working tree)

## Stop conditions

HALT and surface BLOCKED report to the human (do NOT emit `<promise>PLAN_IMPROVED</promise>`) when ANY of the following structural blockers fires:

1. No-improvement detected for 2 consecutive iterations (same score, same `reasons`).
2. Hard cap fires that cannot be auto-resolved (INVALID at 49 — `/plan-improve` does NOT fix hard caps per `cycle-plan.md § Verdicts`). Recommend `/to-plan` rewrite.
3. ADR alternative cannot be credibly proposed by Phase B → leave TODO comment, surface for human.
4. Coverage Matrix gap cannot be deferred via existing ADR justification → leave TODO comment.
5. Post-promise sanity check (Step 6) detects score-disk drift → re-invoke OR HALT after 2 retries.

The promise `<promise>PLAN_IMPROVED</promise>` is emitted EXCLUSIVELY when the score on disk reaches `--target`. There is no path that emits the promise on a partial improvement. In all blocker cases, `cycle-plan` downstream phases MUST NOT proceed treating the plan as auto-improved. Honest BLOCKED > false IMPROVED (Unbreakable Rule 3).

## Fix categories (4 active in v1)

| Fix | Phase | Mechanism | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weak imperatives (should/could/may/might/deveria/poderia) | A — deterministic | regex (skips code blocks + task headers) | Low |
| Loopholes (if possible, when applicable, …) | A — deterministic | regex (skips code blocks) | Low |
| TDD template in bug-fix tasks | A — deterministic | template injection before #### Acceptance Criteria | Low |
| ADR alternatives | B — LLM | Claude reads ADR context, proposes plausible alternative, adds to Rationale; if not credible, leaves a TODO | Medium |

**Phase A (apply_fixes.py)** is invoked first via Bash. **Phase B (LLM)** runs only if Phase A doesn't reach target.

## Anti-patterns

- The skill NEVER touches files outside `{PLAN_PATH}`.
- The skill NEVER commits or pushes to git.
- The skill NEVER emits `<promise>PLAN_IMPROVED</promise>` falsely — Step 6 sanity check enforces.
- The skill NEVER spawns concurrent ralph-loops on overlapping state (Step 4 pre-flight guard).
- The skill NEVER emits the completion promise as a graceful exit from a stop condition — when a blocker fires, the skill HALTS and surfaces a BLOCKED report without promise. Forbidden per-iteration practices are enumerated in `prompts/improvement-prompt.md § Invariants you SHALL NOT violate`.

## Hard limits

- `apply_fixes.py` is DETERMINISTIC — same input always produces same output. Idempotent: running twice = no second change.
- Phase B LLM iterations use the main model.
- The loop has no iteration cap; it runs until the target verdict is reached on disk OR a stop condition fires. If many iterations pass without convergence and no-progress is detected, the no-improvement stop condition (see § Stop conditions) HALTS the loop honestly without emitting the promise.

## Output

When the loop completes:

```
=== Plan-Improve complete ===
Plan: <slug>
Initial verdict: NON_SHIPPABLE (49.0)
Final verdict:   SHIPPABLE_WITH_CAVEATS (72.3)
Iterations:      8

Changes applied:
  weak_imperatives: 23
  loopholes: 7
  tdd_template: 2
  adr_alternatives: 4

Remaining issues (need human):
  - D5 — alternatives left as TODO comment (loop could not find credible alt)
  - Coverage Matrix row 8 — unmapped gap, marked TODO (loop could not justify deferral)

Diff: <git diff against working tree>
```

## Limitations (honest)

- **Phase A fixes can over-correct.** Replacing "should" with "must" everywhere may make some sentences sound forced ("must consider X" instead of "should consider X"). Acceptable trade-off because the rubric explicitly penalizes "should" as weak.
- **Phase B (ADR alternatives) depends on LLM judgment.** The loop instructs Claude to leave TODO comments rather than fabricate, but the line between "credible alternative" and "fabricated text" is judgment-call.
- **Unmapped Coverage Matrix gaps** require either (a) creating new tasks (Phase B doesn't do this — too risky) or (b) marking as deferred (only if a real ADR justifies it). Most unmapped gaps will require human intervention.
- **Loop terminates** when EITHER target verdict reached on disk (promise emitted) OR a stop condition fires (HALT without promise — see § Stop conditions).
