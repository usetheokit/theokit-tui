"""L1 — Snapshot regression tests over real plans in the project.

Pins the expected verdict + score band for each real plan to detect silent
behavior drift. If a detector change moves a plan into a different band
(e.g., SHIPPABLE -> NON_SHIPPABLE), this test fails LOUDLY and forces
an explicit decision: either accept the new behavior (update snapshot) or
revert the detector change.

We pin BAND (not exact score) because exact scores can shift slightly with
detector refinements. Bands are the semantic gate.
