This skill takes the current conversation context, any `/grill-me` output at `knowledge-base/grills/{slug}-grill.md`, and codebase understanding, then produces a detailed implementation plan. Do NOT interview the user during `/to-plan` itself — if requirements are unclear, halt and recommend `/grill-me {topic-slug}` first. When a grill output exists, the plan's `## Context` section MUST cite specific decisions resolved during grilling.

## Process

### Step 0 — MANDATORY: Read `rules/` AND scan generated patterns skills BEFORE anything else

Every plan SHALL comply 100% with the architecture rules and project patterns in `rules/` AND with any first-class "patterns" skills present in `skills/`. This is the FIRST thing the agent does — before exploring code, before drafting the plan, before writing ADRs.

```bash
# 1. Project rules (load all)
ls rules/ 2>/dev/null | head -40

# 2. Patterns skills (frontmatter scan — read description only, then full Read if match)
for d in skills/*-patterns/ ; do
  [ -d "$d" ] && head -8 "$d/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
done
```

#### Patterns skill discovery (when a domain "patterns" skill exists)

Skills whose name ends with `-patterns` encapsulate Patterns + Recommendations + Cross-cutting Comparisons distilled from research investigations (typically a `/discover-execute` blueprint). Author them on demand with the standalone `/skill-creator`. If any exist in `skills/`, treat them as load-bearing project patterns.

**How to consume a patterns skill in /to-plan:**

1. Scan the frontmatter `description` of every `*-patterns/SKILL.md` (cheap — just `head -8` is enough).
2. If the topic-slug of the current `/to-plan` invocation OR any keyword from the user's request matches a trigger phrase in a patterns skill's `description`, Read the full SKILL.md.
3. The plan you produce SHOULD:
   - Cite the Patterns from the matched skill when an implementation decision matches one
   - Reference the Recommendations as ADR alternatives in the plan's own ADR section
   - Use the Key evidence citations as anchor evidence
4. To OVERRIDE a Pattern from a `-patterns` skill, the plan MUST include an ADR that names the patterns skill + the specific pattern + the reason for divergence. Silent contradiction violates `/to-plan` quality rules.

> **This is enforced, not advisory.** `/plan-confidence` runs `check_patterns_consumption.py`: a `*-patterns` skill whose `description:` matches the plan's title/Goal MUST be cited in the plan body OR named in an override ADR. Otherwise the plan is hard-capped at 49 (`patterns_skill_ignored` → INVALID). The matching skill can no longer be silently ignored.

Read each `.md` file in `rules/`. Internalize:

- **architecture rules** (e.g., `architecture.md`) — dependency direction, layering, allowed imports between the project's modules
- **testing rules** (e.g., `testing.md`) — TDD, coverage, pyramid (unit/integration/e2e), fixture conventions
- **language / style rules** — naming conventions, imports hygiene, prohibited patterns
- **golden rules** (e.g., `plan-confidence-golden-rule.md`) — inviolable constraints (Coverage Matrix 100%, no fabricated citations, ADR alternatives required, TDD in bug-fix tasks)
- **allowlists with sunset** (e.g., `plan-confidence-allowlist.txt`) — known-debt entries with expiry dates

**Fallback (if `rules/` does NOT exist or is empty):** read defaults bundled at `skills/plan-confidence/defaults/` (SOLID, DRY, Clean Code, LoC ~500, testing). These defaults are FALLBACK ONLY — project rules win when present.

The plan SHALL:

- Cite at least one rule by filename (e.g., `architecture.md`) or principle (SOLID/DRY/KISS/YAGNI) in the ADR Rationale section.
- Respect file size budgets in `Files to edit` (default 500 LoC; see `rules/architecture.md` for project-specific budgets or `skills/plan-confidence/defaults/loc-limits.md` as fallback).
- Honor the dependency direction declared in `architecture.md` (project-specific DIP boundaries).
- Include tests per `testing.md` (or defaults).
- Include Global DoD entries that reference quality gates (lint, complexity, size, code-audit).

If the agent does not honor Step 0, `/plan-confidence` will deduct via the `architecture_compliance` sub-report and may apply `soft_floor_low_architecture_compliance` (cap 89).

#### Pre-flight path validation

Every plan task's `#### Files to edit` AND `#### TDD` test paths MUST be reachable by an existing test runner config. The `/to-plan` author MUST validate path patterns BEFORE writing the plan, by running the project's test runner discovery commands (e.g., `find . -name "Makefile" -maxdepth 2`, `cat package.json | jq .scripts`, `cat pyproject.toml`).

When writing a task that creates a NEW test path, verify against the runner configs. If the test path won't be picked up by the configured runner, either pick a path that matches OR add the config update as a sub-step in the SAME task's "Files to edit".

When in doubt, prefer placing unit tests co-located with the file under test (per the convention declared in `rules/testing.md § Test pairing convention`).

### Step 1 — Deep review of the current state (MANDATORY)

The plan's `## Baseline Context` section is generated from THIS step's evidence. Skipping or hand-waving Step 1 means `## Baseline Context` will be fabricated, which `/plan-confidence` catches and caps to INVALID. This is the deepest non-negotiable change introduced by the SOTA template upgrade: **a junior reading the plan must NOT have to spelunk the repo to understand what exists today.**

Run, at minimum, the following commands and capture their output:

```bash
# 1. Enumerate every file the plan will touch (work backwards from the user's request)
#    For each candidate file, capture LoC + last meaningful commit + the reason it exists.
wc -l <candidate-file>                                       # LoC today
git log -1 --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short -- <file>  # last touch
git log --oneline -5 -- <file>                                # short history
git blame -L1,5 <file>                                        # original intent of the top of the file

# 2. Enumerate current callers of every public symbol the plan will change
grep -rln 'symbolName' --include='*.<ext>' <src-roots> | grep -v '<test-roots>'    # production callers
grep -rln 'symbolName' --include='*.<ext>' <test-roots>                            # test callers
# Cross-repo callers (when the symbol is part of a published interface): the user MUST point you at consumers; do not guess.

# 3. Identify architecture boundaries that the plan crosses
cat rules/architecture.md            # DIP boundaries, allowed imports, layering
grep -E '^## ' rules/architecture.md  # quick section index

# 4. Extract domain-specific terms the plan will use
#    Read the relevant module README / package-level docstring; list 3-7 terms with one-line definitions.

# 5. Discover prior art ALREADY available in this repo
ls knowledge-base/discoveries/blueprints/ 2>/dev/null   # blueprints from /discover-execute runs
ls skills/*-patterns/ 2>/dev/null                       # domain patterns skills (authored via /skill-creator)
ls knowledge-base/references/ 2>/dev/null               # cloned reference projects (read-only)
```

The captured output feeds the `## Baseline Context` table directly. **If a row in the table cannot cite a `file:line` or a real `<sha>`, the row is fabricated and must be removed.**

Honesty gates that apply to Step 1:

- If you cannot identify the public callers of a symbol the plan modifies, STOP and ask the user — do not guess. Half the bugs caught in `/review` start with "we did not know X also called this."
- If `knowledge-base/discoveries/blueprints/` is empty for the topic AND no `*-patterns` skill matches, the `## Prior Art & Related Work` section must say "(none identified — first-of-its-kind in this codebase)" — `/edge-case-plan` will challenge that.

### Step 2 — Architecture Snapshot (BEFORE) — OPTIONAL

This step is for projects that have wired a **project-specific** architecture-docs skill (e.g., a custom `/architecture-docs` skill that emits Mermaid diagrams of the affected packages). The planning ecosystem does NOT ship one — it is an extension point. If your project has installed such a skill under its own `skills/` directory, run it for the affected domain(s) and save the current-state architecture docs to `knowledge-base/architecture/{domain}/`. The diagrams complement the `## Baseline Context` table from Step 1.

If no such skill is installed (the default), the `## Baseline Context` table from Step 1 IS the baseline — no extra step needed.

### Step 3 — Identify the modules

You will need to build or modify. Actively look for opportunities to extract deep modules (lots of functionality behind a simple, testable interface that rarely changes). Check with the user that these modules match their expectations and which modules need tests.

**Compliance discipline:** for each module decision, justify against the rules read in Step 0. Example: "We split `foo.ts` into 3 files because it would exceed 500 LoC per `architecture.md`" or "We use interface `Foo` over concrete `FooImpl` per DIP (per `architecture.md`)".

### Step 4 — Write the plan

Use the template below and save to `knowledge-base/plans/{slug}-plan.md` via the **Write** tool (not `Bash` with heredoc — the Write tool gives the harness a proper diff for permission prompts). The slug should be kebab-case derived from the plan title.

The plan MUST include:

- A `## Goal` section in the canonical SMART format defined in [`templates/plan-template.md § Goal`](./templates/plan-template.md): one sentence, action-oriented verb, one named observable metric. Vague verbs (`improve`, `enhance`, `better`, `optimize` without a number, `clean up`) are forbidden as the primary verb.
- ADR Rationale citing project rules or principles (Step 0).
- Global DoD with quality-gate entries (lint, complexity, size).
- File size budget mention (default 500 LoC; see `rules/architecture.md` for project-specific budgets, or `skills/plan-confidence/defaults/loc-limits.md` as fallback).

## Plan Template

Every plan MUST follow the canonical template at [`templates/plan-template.md`](./templates/plan-template.md). It contains the section structure (Context → Objective → ADRs → Dependency Graph → Phases → Coverage Matrix → Global DoD → Final Phase: Integration Validation) and is the single source of truth — never duplicate it elsewhere.

When generating a plan, read that file and copy everything inside its `<plan-template>` block into `knowledge-base/plans/{slug}-plan.md`, replacing the `{...}` placeholders.


## Quality Rules

These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE for every plan produced by this skill:

0. **Goal is one sentence + one metric** — the `## Goal` section MUST follow the SMART format in [`templates/plan-template.md § Goal`](./templates/plan-template.md): action-oriented verb, single observable metric (test pass, benchmark threshold, counter non-zero, coverage %), no vague verbs. If the goal cannot fit one sentence with one metric, split the plan. The Goal is the contract `/plan-confidence`, `/implement`, and `/review` cite.

1. **Every task has TDD** — no task without RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. Tests are listed BEFORE implementation steps.

2. **Every task has "Files to edit"** — exact paths, not vague references. If a file doesn't exist yet, say "(NEW)". Every file listed here MUST also appear in `## Baseline Context § Files that will be touched`.

3. **Every task has "Deep file dependency analysis"** — understand what you're touching and what depends on it. Citations resolve against `## Baseline Context § Current callers`.

4. **Every task has "Why this step"** — ReAct discipline: one paragraph for the action, one paragraph for the reasoning chain (cite ADR, prior-art entry, or Baseline Context row). A junior reading only this subsection understands both the move and the motivation.

5. **Every task has acceptance criteria** — observable, verifiable conditions. Include code-audit checks.

6. **Every task has DoD** — definition of done with concrete verification commands.

7. **ADRs justify decisions** — no implementation detail appears without a rationale. If you chose approach A over B, say why. Every ADR includes at least one rejected alternative with reason.

8. **Dependency graph is explicit** — which phases block which. Which can parallelize.

9. **Evidence-driven** — every phase/task references concrete evidence (data, logs, `file:line` from code analysis) that justifies its existence. No speculative tasks.

10. **No file paths in ADRs** — ADRs describe architectural decisions, not implementation details. File paths go in tasks.

11. **Coverage matrix is complete** — every original requirement/gap maps to at least one task. 100% coverage is the target.

12. **Baseline Context section is mandatory** — `## Baseline Context` is populated from the Step 1 evidence (file table with LoC + git sha, callers list, glossary, architecture boundaries). Fabricated rows cap the plan at INVALID. A junior reads this section to understand "what exists today" without reading the codebase.

13. **Prior Art & Related Work section is mandatory** — `## Prior Art & Related Work` cites internal blueprints, patterns skills, reference projects, OR external literature. "(none identified)" is acceptable but `/edge-case-plan` will challenge it.

14. **Drawbacks & Risks section is mandatory** — `## Drawbacks & Risks` has ≥ 2 entries with severity + mitigation + owner. No plan is risk-free; missing or under-populated section caps the plan at 70 (SHIPPABLE_WITH_CAVEATS at best).

15. **Unresolved Questions section is mandatory** — `## Unresolved Questions` lists open questions OR explicitly states "(none — every decision is resolved at plan time)". Empty/missing section caps at 70.

16. **Concurrency tests are conditional but mandatory when applicable** — when the plan's Baseline Context / Deep Dives / Files-to-edit contains concurrency signals (mutex, lock, async/await, goroutine, atomic counter, channel, threading), every task MUST declare its concurrency posture in `#### Concurrency tests` with either an acceptable race-aware signal (race detector / loom / atomic-counter invariant / cancellation propagation) OR the explicit `(none — single-threaded)` escape. Single-thread TDD does NOT catch race conditions; the race-aware test is the only proof the invariant holds. Plans without concurrency signals are unaffected.

17. **Failure scenarios are conditional but mandatory when applicable** — when the plan touches external I/O (HTTP client, DB driver, queue, gRPC, socket, object store), the `## Failure scenarios` section MUST list ≥ 1 scenario per external dependency: failure mode + how the test reproduces it + expected behavior. Happy-path tests do NOT prove resilience. Explicit `(none — no external I/O touched)` is honored when applicable. Plans without external I/O are unaffected.

18. **Integration validation is mandatory** — every plan MUST include a final "Integration Validation" phase. The plan is NOT complete until the full chain (test, typecheck/lint, coverage gate, **failure-scenarios chaos pass when applicable**) passes. No exceptions. This is the "eat your own cooking" gate — if integration tests fail or types break, the plan failed.

## Cycle contract

This skill is **phase 1** of [`cycle-plan`](../../rules/cycle-plan.md). The cycle rule is the **source of truth** for:

- Chain order (this skill → `/edge-case-plan` → `/plan-confidence` → optional `/plan-improve` → `/plan-confidence` re-score)
- Hard gates (Coverage Matrix 100%, ADR alternatives, TDD in bug-fix tasks, fabricated citations)
- Soft gates (NON_SHIPPABLE verdict, smell density, low architecture compliance)
- Stop conditions (no-improvement, hard-cap blockers, human-needed gaps)
- Anti-patterns at the cycle level (skip edge-case-plan, advance with INVALID, fabricate paths, override patterns silently)
- Rollback procedures
- Companion cycles: upstream `cycle-discover.md` (provides `*-patterns` skills); downstream `cycle-implement.md` (consumes the validated plan)

**Read `cycle-plan.md` before invoking this skill.** This SKILL.md retains only phase-specific detail (the protocol below for generating the implementation plan).

## Post-implementation responsibilities live elsewhere

Plan compliance audit, integration validation, and architecture-boundary review are NOT this skill's job — they belong to the downstream cycles:

- **Validation gates** (test, typecheck/lint, coverage, wiring triad) → `/implement` → final report at `knowledge-base/reviews/{slug}-implement-validate-{date}.md`.
- **Line-by-line plan vs implementation cross-validation + severity-classified findings** → `/review` → final report at `knowledge-base/reviews/{slug}-review-{date}.md`.
- **Architecture diff** (boundaries evolved? `rules/architecture.md` needs updating?) → caught by `/review`'s `architecture-reviewer` agent + handled by the human in the SAME PR commit that touches the boundary.

If a plan touches architectural boundaries (DIP rules in `architecture.md`, new public exports, new schemas/types/contracts), the plan SHOULD include an ADR proposing the boundary change. `/implement` follows the plan; `/review` flags any divergence.
