# Mini review — m3-agent-surface — Phase 2

**Date:** 2026-07-06
**Verdict:** `PHASE_REVIEW_PASS`
**Max severity:** `MEDIUM`

This is the **Step 4.7 phase-boundary mini review** — runs at the end of every
phase, before the next phase begins (cycle-implement.md § Hard gates). Companion
to `/review` (which runs once at the end of all phases).

## Findings summary

| Severity | Count |
|---|---|
| BLOCKER | 0 |
| HIGH | 0 |
| MEDIUM | 1 |
| LOW | 0 |
| INFO | 2 |

## Findings

### [MEDIUM] no_declared_scope

Phase 2 tasks did not declare `#### Files to edit` sections. Cannot compare against declared scope; scope-drift detection skipped.

### [INFO] phase_dod_absent

Plan does not declare a `### Phase 2 — Definition of Done` section (optional).

### [INFO] cross_layer_check_skipped

Cross-layer cohesion detection requires per-project layer config in rules/architecture.md. Skipped — implement when project declares its layers.

## Check details

### 1. Phase completeness

- total_tasks_in_phase: 1
- committed: 1
- blocked: 0
- pending: 0
- phase_dod_present: False

### 2. Diff cohesion

- declared_files: 0
- modified_files: 7
- drift_files: 0
- diff_source: `git`

### 3. Wiring summary

- status: `PASS`
- symbols_checked: 15
- pillar_a_fails: 0

### 4. Code-quality delta

- status: `SKIP`
- reason: delta-scoped code-quality not implemented yet; full audit runs at Step 5

## Recommendation

Phase passes mini review. Halt-loop may proceed to next phase.
