# How to use the Cycle ecosystem

A stack-agnostic, domain-agnostic pipeline for taking a feature from **idea → discovery → plan → code → merge**, with Claude Code as the active agent at every cycle. Each cycle has hard gates, anti-patterns, rollback, and an audit trail documented in `rules/cycle-*.md`.

```
DISCOVER → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → CODE-QUALITY → REVIEW → RELEASE → ANALYSIS (opt-in)
   ↓         ↓        ↓             ↓            ↓        ↓           ↓
(knowledge  (plans/) (commits +   (dead-code/  (gate    (develop→   (benchmarks,
 -base/    →         tests)      fabrication/  tighter)  main PR +   architecture,
 discoveries/)                    wiring)               semver tag)  scalability
                                                                     → trajectory
                                                                       verdict)
                                                                         ↓
                                              ON_TRACK → next milestone normally
                                              WITH_RISKS → next milestone + risk tasks
                                              CORRECTION → /to-plan corretivo primeiro
                                              RETHINK → /discover-plan + redesign
```

Each arrow is an **unbreakable chain** — you don't skip a cycle, you don't advance past an INVALID verdict. The ANALYSIS cycle is the post-release feedback loop: its verdict determines the shape of the next iteration.

## Which cycle, when

| Question | Cycle | Entry point |
|---|---|---|
| "Brand new project — idea only, nothing built yet" | (one-shot bootstrap) | `/roadmap-init {project-slug}` |
| "Add a NEW feature to an existing roadmap (becomes M<N+1>)" | (one-shot amendment) | `/roadmap-feature {feature-slug}` |
| "ROADMAP exists; advance the next milestone end-to-end autonomously" | `cycle-roadmap` (delegates to `cycle-auto-plan`) | `/auto-plan` (no arg) or `/auto-plan M<N>` |
| "How does <project X> handle <Y>?" | `cycle-discover` | `/discover-plan {topic-slug}` |
| "I want to do X but haven't articulated requirements yet" | `cycle-plan` Phase 0 | `/grill-me {topic-slug}` |
| "Let's design feature Y" | `cycle-plan` | `/to-plan` |
| "Build the feature per the plan" | `cycle-implement` | `/implement {plan-slug}` |
| "Audit dead code + fabricated APIs post-implement" | `cycle-code-quality` | `/code-quality` |
| "Review before merge" | `cycle-review` | `/review {plan-slug}` |
| "Cut a release (develop → main + tag)" | `cycle-release` | `/release [bump-level]` |
| "Just locate something in the code" | (no cycle) | Glob/Grep directly OR `/ast-grep` for structural queries |
| "Ad-hoc work outside the roadmap (hotfix, exploratory)" | `cycle-auto-plan` direct | `/auto-plan {topic-slug}` (no `M<N>`) |
| "Post-release: o projeto está no caminho certo? (benchmarks + evidence)" | `cycle-analysis` (opt-in, after release) | `/analysis [plan-slug]` |

## Quick start

### 1. Investigate underlying technology

Before writing code, investigate prior art:

```
/discover-plan {topic-slug}
  → produces knowledge-base/discoveries/plans/{slug}-plan.md
/discover-edge-cases {slug}
  → MUST-FIX absorbed into the plan
/discover-plan-confidence {slug}
  → plan-gate: structural score of the discovery plan itself; INVALID returns to /discover-plan
/discover-execute {slug}
  → halt-loop investigates (sources per rules/discover-web-allowlist.txt and clones in knowledge-base/references/)
/discover-confidence {slug}
  → blueprint score; INVALID returns to /discover-plan
/discover-improve {slug}        [optional — only if score is NEEDS_REVISION]
  → the blueprint is the cycle's terminal artifact
/skill-creator                  [optional, out of cycle] — distil a SHIPPABLE blueprint
                                  into a first-class skill at skills/{purpose}/,
                                  consumed by /to-plan in future plans
```

### 2. Plan a feature

Optional Phase 0 — when requirements are vague:

```
/grill-me {topic-slug}
  → interview-driven requirements resolution (one question at a time, codebase-first)
  → produces knowledge-base/grills/{slug}-grill.md with verdict
  → READY_FOR_PLAN → proceed to /to-plan; NEEDS_SPLIT → split topic; NEEDS_DISCOVERY → run /discover-plan first
```

Then the plan chain:

```
/to-plan "{one-sentence feature description}"
  → Step 0 reads rules/ AND skills/*-patterns/ (auto-discovery)
  → produces knowledge-base/plans/{slug}-plan.md
/edge-case-plan {slug}
  → MUST-FIX absorbed
/deps-audit {slug}
  → audits dependencies + CVEs before the plan advances
/plan-confidence {slug}
  → score; if low:
/plan-improve {slug}
/plan-confidence {slug}  [re-score]
  → if ≥ SHIPPABLE_WITH_CAVEATS: plan ready for /implement
```

### 3. Implement

```
git switch -c feature/my-feature   # or stay on develop (Unbreakable Rule 4)
/implement {plan-slug}
  → halt-loop task by task: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → WIRING → COMMIT
  → wiring triad enforced: caller + integration test + runtime metric
  → produces commits + knowledge-base/implementations/{slug}-implementation.md
  → final validation: tests + linters + coverage + wiring summary
```

### 4. Review before merge

```
/code-quality {plan-slug}              # MANDATORY before /review (cycle-code-quality)
  → audits dead code / fabricated symbols / wiring gaps
  → verdict: PASS / PASS_WITH_CAVEATS / FAIL_SOFT / FAIL_HARD / INVALID
  → /review refuses to start if verdict is below PASS_WITH_CAVEATS

/review {plan-slug}
  → detect domain; spawn 5-7 specialist agents (architecture, tests, wiring, cross-validation, domain-specific)
  → run in parallel; consolidate findings by severity (BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO)
  → re-validate quality gates with tighter thresholds
  → analyze edge-case coverage
  → verdict: READY_TO_MERGE / NEEDS_FIXES / NEEDS_DEEPER
  → produces knowledge-base/reviews/{slug}-review-{date}.md
  → audit trail in agents/review-{slug}-{date}/
```

### 5. Release (develop → main + semver tag)

```
/release [patch|minor|major]
  → derives next version (auto-bump from CHANGELOG sections when omitted)
  → rewrites [Unreleased] under [{version}] - {date}
  → commits "chore(release): {version}" on develop
  → opens PR develop → main with rendered release notes
  → pauses for human approval (the only manual gate — Unbreakable Rule 4)
  → on merge: creates annotated tag + gh release create
  → records run at knowledge-base/releases/v{version}-release.md
```

## Utility skills (outside the pipeline)

These skills don't belong to any cycle — invoke them ad-hoc when the task calls for it. They never block the pipeline; nothing else consumes their output.

| Skill | Use when | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `/ast-grep` | You need a code query Grep can't express: function signatures, class hierarchies, decorator + function pairs, call sites, type defs. Especially useful inside `knowledge-base/references/` during discovery. | Stdout |
| `/excalidraw` | The user wants a visual diagram (workflow, architecture, concept). Standalone or as input to `/marp-slide` and `/deck`. | `.excalidraw` JSON file |
| `/marp-slide` | The user wants slides only (no full deck with diagrams). | Self-contained `.md` + rendered `.html` + `.pptx` |
| `/deck` | The user wants a full presentation with visuals. Orchestrates `/marp-slide` + `/excalidraw`. | Full deck (HTML + PPTX + diagrams) |

## Commands (parallel utilities)

Commands live in `commands/` and are invoked by slash. They run alongside the cycle pipeline — none of them replaces a cycle.

| Command | What it does | When |
|---|---|---|
| `/plan-attest {slug}` | Computes SHA256 of the active plan file and stores it under `.attestations/{slug}.sha256`. Subsequent `userpromptsubmit-inject.sh` runs verify the live plan against this hash; mismatch blocks prompt injection. | Run after every intentional edit to a plan file. |
| `/plan-goal [extra-condition]` | Derives a goal condition from the active plan (Objective checkboxes + Goal metric + Global DoD) and invokes Claude Code's built-in `/goal`. | When you want `/goal`-driven termination tied to the plan file. |
| `/plan-loop [interval] [prompt]` | Runs a planning-aware tick on top of Claude Code's `/loop`. Default tick re-reads the active plan + recent progress and writes a progress entry. | When you want recurring cadence ("babysit my plan"); pairs with `/plan-goal` for termination. |

These commands are complementary to ralph-loop, not replacements. Skills like `/implement` still use ralph-loop by default; commands provide a lightweight alternative for users who prefer Claude Code's native `/goal` + `/loop` primitives.

## `knowledge-base/references/`

Read-only enforced by `hooks/boundary-check.sh` + `hooks/validate-command.sh`. Holds clones of **reference projects** for domain study.

**Bootstrap mechanism:** the hooks block mv/cp/rm/sed/tee/redirect into `references/` and `tools/` by default. To populate a new clone, create the marker file `.references-bootstrap` at the project root (with rationale inside), run the `git clone` / `mv`, delete the marker, and cite the source in `CHANGELOG.md` when it exists.

## The 4+1 cycle rules — single source of truth

Read the cycle rule BEFORE invoking a skill:

| Rule | Skills it governs | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| `cycle-discover.md` | discover-plan, discover-edge-cases, discover-plan-confidence, discover-execute, discover-confidence, discover-improve (skill distillation via standalone `/skill-creator` is out of cycle) | Investigating underlying technology or domain reference |
| `cycle-plan.md` | grill-me (opt. Phase 0), to-plan, edge-case-plan, deps-audit, plan-confidence, plan-improve | Designing a feature |
| `cycle-implement.md` | implement | Building the planned feature |
| `cycle-code-quality.md` | code-quality | Auditing dead code / fabricated symbols / wiring gaps post-implement |
| `cycle-review.md` | review | Reviewing before merge |
| `cycle-release.md` | release | Cutting a release after `/review` returned `READY_TO_MERGE` |
| `cycle-auto-plan.md` | auto-plan (orchestrator) | The topic is large and you want an autonomous chain |

Each cycle rule has: Purpose, Trigger conditions, Chain (unbreakable), Phase contracts, Hard gates, Stop conditions, Anti-patterns, Rollback.

## Unbreakable principles (apply everywhere)

From `/home/paulo/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Apply in every cycle:

1. **95% confidence rule** — never proceed without 95%+ certainty; ask when unsure.
2. **Task completion gate** — finish the current task before starting a new one.
3. **Extreme honesty** — admit ignorance; expose risks; never invent state.
4. **Git rules** — NEVER `git checkout` / `git revert` / `git push --force` / `git reset --hard` / commit directly to `main`.
5. **TDD-first** — failing test before code; bug fix starts with a regression test.
6. **CHANGELOG discipline** — every change in `[Unreleased]`.
7. **Don't reinvent** — mature libraries exist; prefer composition over rewriting.

These rules are enforced by hooks (`hooks/`) and declarative gates in each cycle rule.

## Match the cycle to the shape of the work

Each cycle is heavyweight by design — they trade speed for evidence. Pick the lightest entry point that fits:

| Cycle | Best for | When NOT to use |
|---|---|---|
| `cycle-discover` (full chain) | Investigating prior art / unknown solutions | Question is text-shape (use Read + Grep) |
| `cycle-plan` (full chain) | Clear feature with known shape | Trivial change (single-line; write it) |
| `cycle-implement` (halt-loop) | Building per an approved plan | No plan (run cycle-plan first) |
| `cycle-review` (5-7 agents) | Pre-merge rigorous review | Tiny PR (use built-in `/review`) |
| `/auto-plan` (super-cycle) | Large, well-scoped topic warranting autonomy | Plan already exists (call `/implement` directly) |

The cheapest cycle is the one you don't run. Don't invoke a cycle for work that doesn't justify the rigor.

## Pre-conditions for new contributors

Before invoking any cycle skill, verify:

- [ ] `ralph-loop` plugin enabled (`jq '.enabledPlugins' ~/.claude/settings.json`) — REQUIRED by `/implement`, `/discover-execute`, `/plan-improve`. Without it, those skills refuse to start.
- [ ] Python 3.10+ (`python3 --version`)
- [ ] PyYAML installed (`python3 -c "import yaml"`)
- [ ] `ast-grep` installed for structural queries (`ast-grep --version`)
- [ ] Your project's language toolchain is set up (matches `rules/code-quality-languages.txt`)
- [ ] You've read at least `rules/cycle-{target}.md` and the entry-point's `SKILL.md`

### First-time setup notes

- **`.active_plan`** — optional pointer file at the project root with a single slug. When present, `hooks/userpromptsubmit-inject.sh` resolves THIS plan instead of falling back to the newest by mtime. Useful when multiple plans are in flight. See `.active_plan.example`.
- **`.attestations/`** — created on demand by `/plan-attest`. Do not commit (already excluded by hook behavior).
- **`rules/dogfood-golden-rule.md`** — template shipped; edit § 1 (anchor scenario) before invoking `/dogfood` for the first time.
- **`rules/code-quality-languages.txt`** — empty by default; uncomment the languages your project uses.
- **`rules/discover-web-allowlist.txt`** — empty by default; uncomment authoritative domains your `/discover-execute` needs to reach.

## Common questions

### "When to use /grill-me vs. jumping straight to /to-plan?"

- `/grill-me` if requirements are vague, the decision tree has multiple non-obvious branches, OR the user explicitly asks to be grilled. Output is a Q&A log that `/to-plan` consumes as primary context.
- Skip `/grill-me` if you already wrote a spec, the change is trivial (single-line), it's a pure refactor with no behavior change, or the decision tree has < 3 branches.

A previous run of `/to-plan` that produced a vague plan is a strong signal to re-start with `/grill-me`.

### "When to use /to-plan vs. /discover-plan?"

- `/to-plan` produces an **implementation plan** (what to build, how, in what order).
- `/discover-plan` produces a **discovery plan** (what to investigate in `references/` or on the web).

If you don't know how others solved the problem → `/discover-plan`. If you know the problem and need to plan implementation → `/to-plan`.

### "Can I skip /discover-edge-cases?"

No. The chain is unbreakable. Edge cases caught pre-implementation are 100× cheaper than those caught post-implementation.

### "What if /plan-confidence returns INVALID?"

INVALID = hard cap fired (Coverage Matrix < 100% OR fabricated citation). Return to `/to-plan` to fix structurally. Do NOT go to `/plan-improve` — improve doesn't fix hard caps.

### "How do I roll back a patterns skill?"

```bash
rm -rf skills/{purpose}/
```

`/to-plan` stops discovering it via Step 0 on the next run. (Skills are authored directly under `skills/` via the standalone `/skill-creator`; there is no separate staging area.)

### "How do I adapt this to my specific stack and domain?"

The defaults in `rules/` are stack- and domain-agnostic. To specialize:

1. Add a project-specific section at the bottom of relevant rules (e.g., naming conventions, banned framings, internal component names).
2. Populate `rules/code-quality-languages.txt` with the languages you use.
3. Populate `rules/discover-web-allowlist.txt` with the authoritative sources for your domain.
4. Optionally create `rules/dogfood-golden-rule.md` if your project has an anchor scenario that drives go/no-go decisions.

## Maintenance notes

- Cycle rules are SoT. Changes to chain order, anti-patterns, or gates go in the cycle rule, not in SKILL.md.
- SKILL.md files keep only PHASE-SPECIFIC detail. Generic content found there should move to the cycle rule.
- Cross-reference validation: `python3 scripts/check_xrefs.py` (if present).
- Audit trail rotation: see `rules/audit-trail-rotation.md`.
