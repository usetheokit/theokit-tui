#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Installs the Cycle 6+1 pipeline ecosystem into a target project as a plugin install
# (target/.claude/ layout). Hooks auto-detect the layout, so target/.claude/* is
# picked up identically to the standalone repo.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/install.sh <target-project-dir> [--force]
#
# What it does:
#   1. Validates target is a directory.
#   2. Refuses to overwrite an existing target/.claude/ unless --force.
#   3. Copies skills/, rules/, hooks/, commands/, scripts/, plugin.json,
#      HOW-TO-USE.md into target/.claude/.
#   4. Writes settings.plugin.json as target/.claude/settings.json.
#   5. Creates empty scaffold under target/.claude/knowledge-base/
#      (plans, implementations, reviews, audits, discoveries/{plans,blueprints,snapshots},
#      adrs, grills, dogfood, judge-codex, references, tools) + empty agents/.
#   6. Skips the source repo's history: caches, artifact dirs, audit trails,
#      CHANGELOG.md, .git/, .compaction-snapshots/, .attestations/.
#   7. Prints next steps.
#
# What it does NOT do:
#   - Modify the consumer's CLAUDE.md (write your own pointer to .claude/).
#   - Add anything to .gitignore (consumer decides whether to track .claude/).
#   - Install dependencies (python3, jq, ast-grep, ralph-loop plugin) — see HOW-TO-USE.md.

==> Installation complete.

Next steps for the target project:

  1. (optional) Add a CLAUDE.md at the project root pointing to .claude/ and
     listing project-specific stack/conventions. Hooks read it on SessionStart.

  2. Configure project-specific gates (defaults are no-op until set):
       .claude/rules/code-quality-languages.txt    # uncomment languages you ship
       .claude/rules/discover-web-allowlist.txt    # domains for /discover-execute
       .claude/rules/code-quality-thresholds.txt   # per-project overrides
       .claude/rules/deps-audit-allowlist.txt      # CVE exemptions (with sunset)

  3. Verify ralph-loop plugin is installed (required by /implement, /discover-execute,
     /plan-improve):
       jq '.enabledPlugins' ~/.claude/settings.json | grep ralph-loop

  4. Open the project in Claude Code. The settings.json wires hooks; skills/
     and commands/ are auto-discovered.

  5. First run: /to-plan "{one-sentence feature}"  OR  /grill-me {topic}
